This project was completed as part of **Snowflake Hands-On Essentials â€“ Badge 3 (Streamlit in Snowflake)**.  
The goal was to build a smoothie app using **Python + Streamlit inside Snowflake**, with Snowflake powering the backend.  

---

## ðŸš€ What the project includes  
- **Snowflake setup** â†’ Databases, schemas, and tables for smoothie recipes and ingredients  
- **Data loading** â†’ Staged and loaded structured CSVs and semi-structured JSON into Snowflake  
- **SQL transformations** â†’ Queries to calculate costs, join ingredient data, and clean outputs for the app  
- **Python + Streamlit app** â†’ Interactive front-end where users can pick ingredients and build custom smoothies  
- **Secure views** â†’ Exposed a simplified data layer for the app  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why it matters  
This badge was about combining **data engineering in Snowflake** with **app development in Python**.  
Instead of just querying data, I built an interactive application that runs directly inside Snowflake â€” showing how Snowflake can serve as both the **data warehouse** and the **live backend** for apps.  

---

## ðŸ“š Key takeaways  
- Learned how to load and query both structured and semi-structured data in Snowflake  
- Integrated Python + Streamlit directly with Snowflake  
- Used secure views to create clean outputs for the app  
- Made data interactive by deploying an app within Snowflake  

---

## ðŸ”® Next steps  
- Add customer order history and preferences  
- Connect the app data to BI dashboards (Tableau / Power BI)  
- Explore **Snowpark for Python** to build smoothie recommendations

### Note

The Streamlit app currently has connectivity issues due to an expired Snowflake subscription. As a result, certain features dependent on Snowflake will not be operational until the subscription is renewed. Please be aware of this limitation when using the app.
